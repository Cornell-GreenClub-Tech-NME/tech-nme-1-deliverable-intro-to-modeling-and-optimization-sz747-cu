How can linear programming be incorporated into projects you are currently working on or might work on in the future in GreenClub?
Linear programming can help find the best option on what to do with food waste considering cost and other factors, which can be
helpful for making suggestions to stakeholder on what they should do with their food waste. This extends other aspects of sustainability
goals such as optimitizing energy or water use. It's also helpful for things such as fundraisers where you have to consider cost and profit.
